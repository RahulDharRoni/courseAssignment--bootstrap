                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Started in 2010, Ristorante con Fusion quickly established itself as a culinary icon par
                    excellence in Hong Kong. With its unique brand of world fusion cuisine that can be found nowhere
                    else, it enjoys patronage from the A-list clientele in Hong Kong. Featuring four of the best
                    three-star Michelin chefs in the world, you never know what will arrive on your plate the next
                    time you visit us.</p>
                <p>The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to <em>The Frying Pan</em>, a successful chain
                    started by our CEO, Mr. Peter Pan, that featured for the first time the world's best cuisines in
                    a pan.</p>

                <h3 class="fw-bold">Peter Pan <small class="fw-normal">Chief Epicurious Officer</small></h3>
                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant parents who
                    undertook
                    the arduous
                    journey to the shores of America with the intention of giving their children the best future.
                    His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with whatever is available
                    inexpensively at the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the fusion cuisines for
                    which <em>The Frying Pan</em> became well known. He brings his zeal for fusion cuisines to this
                    restaurant, pioneering cross-cultural culinary connections.</p>
                <h3 class="fw-bold">Dhanasekaran Witherspoon <small class="fw-normal">Chief Food Officer</small></h3>
                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Our CFO, Danny, as he is affectionately referred to by his colleagues,
                    comes from a long
                    established family tradition in farming and produce. His experiences growing up on a farm in the
                    Australian outback gave him great appreciation for varieties of food sources. As he puts it in
                    his own words, <em>Everything that runs, wins, and everything that stays, pays!</em></p>
                <h3 class="fw-bold">Agumbe Tang <small class="fw-normal">Chief Taste Officer</small></h3>
                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Blessed with the most discerning gustatory sense, Agumbe, our CTO,
                    personally ensures that every
                    dish that we serve meets his exacting tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that ensues if
                    their dish does not meet his exacting standards. He lives by his motto, <em>You click only if
                        you survive my lick.</em></p>
                <h3 class="fw-bold">Alberto Somayya <small class="fw-normal">Executive Chef</small></h3>
                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Award winning three-star Michelin chef with wide International experience
                    having worked closely
                    with whos-who in the culinary world, he specializes in creating mouthwatering Indo-Italian
                    fusion experiences. He says, <em>Put together the cuisines from the two craziest cultures, and
                        you get a winning hit! Amma Mia!</em></p>
